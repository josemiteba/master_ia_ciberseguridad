CYBERSECURITY DATABASE PERFORMANCE SUMMARY
==========================================
Project: Tools4Trading Database Optimization - Phase 4
Database: cybersecurity_dataset.db (SQLite)
Generated: 2025-09-13

DATABASE SPECIFICATIONS
-----------------------
- Database Engine: SQLite 3
- Table: network_traffic  
- Total Records: 6,588
- Database Size: 1,474,560 bytes (1.47 MB)
- Data Source: datos_anonimizados.csv (anonymized network traffic)
- Time Period: May 17, 2023 (single day analysis)

SCHEMA OPTIMIZATION
------------------
✓ Optimized table schema with appropriate data types
✓ 5 strategic indexes for query performance:
  - idx_timestamp: Time-based filtering
  - idx_src_ip: Source IP analysis  
  - idx_dst_ip: Destination IP analysis
  - idx_protocol: Protocol filtering
  - idx_dst_port: Port-based queries

QUERY PERFORMANCE METRICS
-------------------------
Query 1 (Total Records): 0.0001s - Excellent
Query 2 (Top Destination IPs): 0.0007s - Excellent  
Query 3 (DNS Queries): 0.0020s - Very Good
Query 4 (Port Analysis): 0.0008s - Excellent
Query 5 (Packet Statistics): 0.0012s - Excellent
Query 6 (Protocol Distribution): 0.0006s - Excellent

Average Query Time: 0.0009 seconds
All queries under 10ms threshold - Optimal for real-time analysis

KEY CYBERSECURITY INSIGHTS
--------------------------

1. TRAFFIC VOLUME ANALYSIS
   - Total network events: 6,588
   - Peak destination: 7a62ce71a155f743 (3,000 connections - 45.5%)
   - Indicates potential central server or target of interest

2. PROTOCOL DISTRIBUTION  
   - TCP: 56.72% (3,737 packets) - Primary application traffic
   - UDP: 43.03% (2,835 packets) - DNS and streaming traffic
   - ICMP: 0.24% (16 packets) - Network diagnostics

3. SERVICE ANALYSIS
   - DNS (port 53): 1,404 requests (21.3%) - High DNS activity
   - HTTPS (port 443): 1,281 connections (19.4%) - Secure web traffic
   - HTTP (port 80): 604 connections (9.2%) - Legacy web traffic
   - Custom port 4132: 159 connections - Potential application-specific service

4. DNS SECURITY PATTERNS
   - Microsoft connectivity check: dns.msftncsi.com (68 queries)
   - Adobe services: armmf.adobe.com (20 queries)  
   - Mozilla Firefox: firefox.settings.services.mozilla.com (20 queries)
   - Certificate validation: ocsp.digicert.com (16 queries)

5. PACKET SIZE ANALYSIS
   - Average packet: 119 bytes - Typical for mixed traffic
   - Maximum packet: 2,974 bytes - Large data transfer
   - Minimum packet: 42 bytes - Protocol headers/ACKs

SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS
-----------------------

1. TRAFFIC MONITORING
   - Monitor destination 7a62ce71a155f743 (45.5% of traffic)
   - Investigate custom port 4132 usage patterns
   - Analyze DNS query patterns for anomalies

2. PROTOCOL SECURITY
   - 9.2% HTTP traffic should migrate to HTTPS
   - Monitor UDP traffic for potential data exfiltration
   - ICMP traffic minimal - good baseline

3. PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATION
   - Current query performance excellent (<10ms)
   - Database suitable for real-time monitoring
   - Consider partitioning for larger datasets

4. ANOMALY DETECTION
   - Large packets (>2000 bytes) warrant investigation
   - Unusual DNS queries outside normal patterns
   - Port scanning detection on non-standard ports

DATABASE SCALABILITY
--------------------
- Current performance: Excellent for 6K records
- Estimated capacity: 1M+ records with current schema
- Partitioning recommendation: Time-based for larger datasets
- Index efficiency: Optimized for common query patterns

DELIVERABLES COMPLETED
---------------------
✓ cybersecurity_dataset.db - SQLite database (1.47 MB)
✓ resultados_consultas.txt - Complete analytical results
✓ database_creator.py - Database creation script (14.2 KB)
✓ verify_database.py - Database verification script
