## Results

### Extraction Statistics
- **Files Processed**: 37/37 PCAP files (100% success rate)
- **Total Packets Analyzed**: 58,111
- **Packets Retained**: 55,662 (95.8%)
- **Packets Filtered**: 2,449 (4.2% network noise removed)
- **Output File Size**: 4.85 MB

### Data Quality Validation
✅ **Format Compliance**: Exactly 11 columns as specified  
✅ **Header Validation**: All required fields present  
✅ **Protocol Mapping**: Numeric protocols converted to names  
✅ **Port Consolidation**: TCP/UDP ports merged correctly  
✅ **Cybersecurity Focus**: Network noise filtered, relevant traffic retained  

## Output Files

### Primary Deliverable
- **`datos_extraidos.csv`** (4.85 MB): Consolidated dataset with 55,662 cybersecurity-relevant records

### Supporting Documentation
- **`extraccion_log.txt`** (9.3 KB): Detailed processing log with per-file statistics
- **`pcap_data_extractor.py`** (15.9 KB): Complete extraction script with documentation

## Data Structure

### Column Schema (11 fields)
```
timestamp, src_ip, dst_ip, protocol, src_port, dst_port, length, dns_query, http_host, http_path, user_agent
```

### Protocol Distribution
- **TCP**: 49,032 packets (88.1%) - Primary application traffic
- **UDP**: 6,613 packets (11.9%) - DNS queries and UDP services  
- **ICMP**: 17 packets (0.03%) - Network diagnostic traffic

### Traffic Characteristics
- **DNS Activity**: 1,459 queries to various domains including suspicious ones
- **HTTP/HTTPS Traffic**: 14,850 web requests across ports 80/443
- **External Communications**: High percentage of traffic to external IPs
- **Security-Relevant Ports**: Captured traffic on ports 21, 22, 23, 25, 3389, etc.

## Filtering Strategy Applied

### Removed (Network Noise)
- ARP, DHCP (ports 67/68)
- SSDP (port 1900), LLMNR (port 5355), mDNS (port 5353)
- NetBIOS (ports 137/138)
- Pure internal-to-internal traffic without security relevance

### Retained (Cybersecurity Relevant)
- All HTTP/HTTPS traffic (ports 80, 443, 8080, 8443)
- DNS queries and responses (port 53)
- External IP communications
- Traffic on security-critical ports (SSH, FTP, RDP, SQL, etc.)
- Any traffic with application-layer data (HTTP headers, DNS queries)

## Sample Data Analysis

### Suspicious Indicators Detected
- Domain queries to `hackorchronix.no-ip.biz` (potential C&C)
- Various external IP communications
- Non-standard port usage patterns
- HTTP traffic with potential reconnaissance patterns

### Geographic Distribution
Traffic observed to/from IPs in multiple ranges suggesting international communications typical of malware or attack scenarios.

## Technical Implementation

### Tools Used
- **Tshark 4.2.2**: Primary packet analysis engine
- **Python 3**: Data processing and filtering logic
- **Pandas**: Data validation and analysis
- **CSV**: Standardized output format

### Processing Performance
- **Average Speed**: ~850 packets/second
- **Memory Usage**: Efficient streaming processing
- **Error Rate**: 0% (all files processed successfully)

## Compliance with Requirements

✅ Processed ALL 37 PCAP files from `pcaps/pcaps_eval/`  
✅ Extracted exactly 11 specified fields  
✅ Used tshark via subprocess as required  
✅ Applied cybersecurity-focused filtering rules  
✅ Created consolidated `datos_extraidos.csv`  
✅ Generated detailed `extraccion_log.txt`  
✅ Implemented proper protocol mapping  
✅ Consolidated TCP/UDP ports correctly  
✅ Validated output format and completeness  

## Next Steps

The extracted dataset is ready for Phase 2 (Data Cleaning) with the following characteristics:
- Clean, structured format suitable for analysis
- Cybersecurity-focused content with minimal noise
- Comprehensive application-layer metadata
- Proper temporal sequencing maintained
- External threat indicators preserved
